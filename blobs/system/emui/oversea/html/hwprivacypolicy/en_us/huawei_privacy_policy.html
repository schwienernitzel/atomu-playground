    <p>I. <span id="label_1"/>How Huawei Collects and Uses Your Personal Data</p>
    <p>A. Personal Data Collected by Huawei</p>
    <p>Before using Huawei products or services, you may need to provide personal data. You do not
        have to provide your personal data to Huawei, but in some cases, the non-provision of
        certain personal data will cause the inability to provide you with some related products or
        services.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>Huawei will collect and use your personal data for the purposes stated in this Statement.
        Here are some examples of personal data we may collect: </p>
    <p>1. Personal data that you provide to Huawei</p>
    <p>You need to register a Huawei ID to enjoy certain functions or services. When you register a
        Huawei ID or log in with a Huawei ID to shop online, download software, or purchase
        services, we will ask you to provide relevant personal data, such as your name, email
        address, mobile number, order information, shipping address, and payment mode.</p>
    <p>Huawei may provide you with cloud storage services where you can sync and backup some of your
        files, pictures and data. </p>
    <p>Some Huawei products allow you to communicate and share information with others. When you use
        a Huawei product to share things with your family and friends, you may need to create a
        Huawei ID that includes certain information which will be made public, including a nickname
        and avatar. Huawei may collect information related to those people, such as their names,
        email addresses, and phone numbers. Huawei will take appropriate and necessary measures to
        ensure the security of the information that you provide. You must ensure that the people,
        whose information you provide, have consented to you providing their information to
        Huawei.</p>
    <p>To meet some jurisdictions' requirements on real-name authentication of accounts, prevention
        of electronic game addiction, or Internet payment, Huawei might ask you to provide a proof
        of identity issued by the government or relevant card information that can identify you.</p>
    <p>2. Information that Huawei collects in your use of services</p>
    <p>Huawei will collect data about your device and how you and your device exchange information
        with Huawei products and services. This type of information includes:</p>
    <p>(1) Device and application information, such as the device name, device identification code
        (IMEI, ESN, MEID, and SN), device activation time, hardware model, OS version, application
        version, software identification code, and device and application settings (such as region,
        language, time zone, and font size).</p>
    <p>(2) Mobile network information, such as the public land mobile network (PLMN) provider ID and
        Internet Protocol (IP) address.</p>
    <p>(3) Log information. When you use Huawei services or view Huawei-provided content, Huawei
        will automatically collect and log some information, such as the time of access, access
        count, IP address, and information about incidents (such as errors, crashes, restarts, and
        upgrades).</p>
    <p>(4) Location information. Huawei will collect, use, and process the approximate or precise
        location of your device when you access some location-based services (for example, when you
        search, use navigation software, or view the weather of a specific location). Location
        information can be obtained based on the GPS, Wi-Fi, and service provider network ID. We
        will ask you to choose the applications for which you <span id="_GoBack"/>want to enable
        location services. In the device settings menu, you can disable the location permissions of
        specific services to reject sharing your location information.</p>
    <p>(5) Information you store on Huawei servers. For example, the information you upload to the
        cloud will be stored on Huawei servers for rapid access and sharing between devices. We will
        not view the information you store on Huawei servers.</p>
    <p>3. Information from third-party sources</p>
    <p>When permitted by law, Huawei will collect information about you from public and commercial
        sources. Huawei may also obtain certain information from third-party social network
        services, such as the time when you use a social network account to log in to a Huawei
        website.</p>
    <p>4. Collection and use of non-identifiable data</p>
    <p>Non-identifiable data refers to data that cannot be used to identify an individual. Examples
        of non-identifiable data include statistics on website visits, application downloads, and
        product sales volume. Huawei will collect statistics information to understand how users use
        our products and services. By doing so, we can improve our services to better meet your
        requirements. </p>
    <p>We keep your personal data and non-identifiable data separate, and use each independently.
        Circumstances may arise where Huawei collects, uses, discloses, and transfers
        non-identifiable data for other purposes at our own discretion.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>B. How Huawei Uses Your Personal Data</p>
    <p>Huawei may use your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
    <p>(1) Register and activate Huawei personal and home products that you have purchased.</p>
    <p>(2) Register a Huawei ID so that you can enjoy a wider range of functions and mobile
        services.</p>
    <p>(3) Deliver, activate, or verify the products and services you have requested, or perform
        changes and provide technical support and after-sales services for the foregoing products
        and services based on your requirements.</p>
    <p>(4) Send you OS or application updates and installation notifications.</p>
    <p>(5) Provide personalised user experience and content.</p>
    <p>(6) Send you information about products and services you might be interested in, invite you
        to Huawei promotional activities and market surveys, or send marketing information to you.
        If you do not want to receive such information, you can opt out at any time.</p>
    <p>(7) Carry out internal auditing, data analysis, and research; analyse business operation
        efficiency and measure market shares; and improve Huawei's products and services.</p>
    <p>(8) Synchronise, share, and store the data you have uploaded or downloaded, as well as the
        data needed for the upload and download operations.</p>
    <p>(9) Improve our loss prevention and anti-fraud programmes.</p>
    <p>(10) Process pursuant to laws and regulations, e.g. tax, authority requests.</p>
    <p>(11) Other purposes within specific services or with your consent.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>II. <span id="label_2"/>How Huawei Uses Cookies and Similar Technologies</p>
    <p>A. Cookie</p>
    <p>A cookie is a text file stored by a web server on a computer or mobile device, and the
        content of a cookie can be retrieved and read only by the server that created the cookie.
        Cookies are unique to the browser or mobile application you are using. The text in a cookie
        often consists of identifiers, site names, and some numbers and characters.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, Huawei stores cookies on computers or mobile devices for the purpose of improving
        user experience, including the following scenarios:</p>
    <p>(1) Technical cookies: Login and verification. When you use a Huawei ID to log in to a
        website, the &ldquo;session-based&rdquo; cookies ensure that your visit to this site
        functions as smoothly as possible. .</p>
    <p>(2) Personalisation cookies: Storage of your preferences and settings. A website can use
        cookies to save settings, such as the language setting and font size on your computer or
        mobile device, items in your shopping cart, and other browser preferences.</p>
    <p>(3) Advertising cookies. Huawei uses cookies to collect information about your online
        activities and interests and provide you with advertisements that correlate most highly with
        you.</p>
    <p>(4) Statistical cookies. With cookies, Huawei can collect information about your use of our
        websites and other applications, either for a single visit (using a session cookie) or for
        repeated visits (using a persistent cookie).</p>
    <p>(5) Social Media Cookies. Social media cookies are linked to services provided by third
        parties, such as &lsquo;Like&rsquo; buttons and &lsquo;Share&rsquo; buttons. The third party
        provides these services in return for recognising that you have visited our websites.</p>
    <p>You can manage or delete cookies at your own preference. For details, visit <a
            href="http://aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">AboutCookies.org</a>. You can clear all
        the cookies stored on your computer, and most current web browsers provide the option of
        blocking cookies. However, blocking cookies will require you to change your user settings
        every time you visit our website. Find out how to manage cookie settings for your browser
        here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/internet-explorer/delete-manage-cookies"
                 target="_blank">Internet Explorer</a> &gt; <a
                href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en" target="_blank">Google
            Chrome</a> &gt; <a
                href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Cookies"
                target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a> &gt; <a
                href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19214?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US"

    <p>If you clear cookies, you will need to change your settings the next time you visit Huawei
        websites. Note that some Huawei services require the use of cookies. Disabling cookies may
        affect your use of some or all functions of these services.</p>
    <p>B. Web Beacons and Pixel Tags</p>
    <p>In addition to cookies, Huawei and some third parties may also use web beacons and pixel tags
        on websites. A web beacon is usually an electronic graphic image embedded into a website or
        email to identify your device cookies when you browse the website or email. Pixel tags allow
        Huawei to send emails in a way that is readable to you and find out whether an email is
        opened.</p>
    <p>Huawei and some third parties use these technologies for various purposes, including
        analysing service usage (together with cookies) and providing more satisfactory content and
        advertisements to you. For example, when you receive an email from Huawei, it may contain a
        click-through URL which links to a Huawei web page. If you click the link, Huawei will track
        your visit to help us learn about your preferences for products and services and improve our
        customer service. You can unsubscribe from the mailing list of Huawei at any time if you do
        not want to be tracked in this manner.</p>
    <p>C. Other Local Storage</p>
    <p>Huawei and some third parties may use other local storage technologies, for example, local
        shared objects (also called &quot;Flash cookies&quot;) and HTML5 local storage, in certain
        products and services. Similar to cookies, these technologies store information on your
        device and can record some information about your activities and preferences. However, these
        technologies may use different media from cookies. Therefore, you may not be able to control
        them using standard browser tools and settings. For details about how to disable or delete
        information contained in Flash cookies, click <a
                href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html"
                target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
    <p>D. Do Not Track</p>
    <p>Many web browsers provide a Do Not Track function that can release Do Not Track requests to
        websites. Currently, major Internet standardisation organisations have not established
        policies to specify how websites should handle these requests. If you enable Do Not Track in
        your browser, all Huawei websites will respect your selection.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>III. <span id="label_3"/>How Huawei Shares Your Personal Data</p>
    <p>We do not share personal data with other companies, organisations and individuals unless one
        of the following circumstances applies:</p>
    <p>(1) Sharing with consent: After obtaining your consent, Huawei will share the information
        that you have authorised with specified third parties or categories of third parties.</p>
    <p>(2) Sharing pursuant to laws and regulations: Huawei may share your information as required
        by laws and regulations, for resolving legal disputes, or as required by administrative or
        judiciary authorities pursuant to law.</p>
    <p>(3) Sharing with Huawei affiliates: Your information may be shared within Huawei's affiliates
        only for explicit, and legitimate purposes, and the sharing is limited only to information
        required by services. For example, we verify the global uniqueness of accounts before
        allowing them to be registered.</p>
    <p>(4) Sharing with business partners: Some products and/or services are provided to you
        directly by our partners. Huawei also may share your information with them, they may use
        your information to provide you with products and/or services you request (e.g., products
        sold by third-party seller through Huawei&rsquo;s e-commerce platform, video content
        provided by other companies through Huawei&rsquo;s applications), make predictions about
        your interests and may provide you with advertisements, promotional materials and other
        materials</p>
    <p>(5) Sharing with service providers: Huawei also may disclose your information to companies
        that provide services for or on behalf of us. Examples of these service providers include
        companies that provide hotline services, send email, or provide technical support on behalf
        of Huawei. The service providers can use your information only for the purpose of providing
        services to you on behalf of Huawei.</p>
    <p>(6) Huawei will share your information when there is a reasonable requirement to do so, for
        example, to meet request of applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
        government.</p>
    <p>In scenarios 3 to 6, Huawei will ensure that the lawfulness of this sharing and sign
        stringent non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and/or data processing clauses with the
        companies, organisations, and individuals with whom personal data is shared, requiring them
        to comply with this Statement and take appropriate confidentiality and security measures
        when processing personal data.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>IV. <span id="label_4"/>How Huawei Protects Your Personal Data</p>
    <p>Huawei attaches great importance to the security of your personal data and has adopted
        standard industry practices to protect your personal data and prevent it from unauthorised
        access, disclosure, use, modification, damage, or loss. To this end, Huawei takes the
        following measures:</p>
    <p>(1) We take reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that the personal data collected is
        minimal and relevant to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
        processed. We retain your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes
        stated in this Statement and privacy notice of specific product or service, unless extending
        the retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
    <p>(2) We use a range of technologies such as cryptographic technologies to ensure the
        confidentiality of data in transmission. We implement trusted protection mechanisms to
        protect data and data storage servers from attacks.</p>
    <p>(3) We deploy access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorised personnel can access
        your personal data. In addition, we control the number of authorised personnel and implement
        hierarchical permission management on them based on service requirements and personnel
        levels.</p>
    <p>(4) We strictly select business partners and service providers and incorporate personal data
        protection requirements into commercial contracts, audits, and appraisal activities. </p>
    <p>(5) We hold security and privacy protection training courses, tests, and publicity activities
        to raise employees' personal data protection awareness.</p>
    <p>Huawei is committed to protecting your personal data. Nevertheless, no security measure is
        perfect and no product, service, website, data transfer, computing system, or network
        connection is absolutely secure.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>To cope with possible risks, such as personal data leakage, damage, and loss, Huawei has
        developed several mechanisms and control measures, clearly defined the rating standards of
        security incidents and vulnerabilities and corresponding processing procedures, and
        established a dedicated <a href="http://www.huawei.com/en/psirt" target="_blank">Security
            Advisory and Security Notice</a> page. Huawei has established a dedicated emergency
        response team to implement security planning, loss reduction, analysis, locating, and
        remediation, and to perform tracking operations with related departments based on security
        incident handling regulations and requirements. </p>
    <p>If any personal data incident occurs, Huawei will notify you, pursuant to relevant legal and
        regulatory requirements, of the basic information about the security incident and its
        possible impact, measures that Huawei has taken or will take, suggestions about active
        defense and risk mitigation, and remedial measures. The notification may take the form of an
        email, text message, push notification, etc. If it is difficult to notify data subjects one
        by one, we will take appropriate and effective measures to release a Security Notice. In
        addition, we will also report the handling status of personal data security incidents as
        required by supervisory authorities.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>V. <span id="label_5"/>How You Can Manage Your Personal Data</p>
    <p>A. Access, rectification, deletion, data portability, restriction of processing, objection to
        processing.</p>
    <p>Legislation in some countries and regions to which Huawei provides products and services or
        from where Huawei processes personal data, provides that data subjects the rights request
        (hereinafter referred to as &quot;requests&quot;) in regards to the accessing, rectifying,
        deleting or erasure, porting, restricting, and objecting, the processing of related personal
        data by Huawei retains. In addition you will have the right to data portability.</p>
    <p>1. Requesting modes and channels</p>
    <p>Data subjects' requests must be submitted in accordance with Huawei designated privacy
        channels. The requests are valid even when the requester does not specify the laws on which
        the requests are based. </p>
    <p>Data subjects' requests may be initiated through the <a
            href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/legal/privacy-questions/" target="_blank">official
        website of Huawei Consumer BG</a>, HiCare app or Huawei ID app. If a data subject initiates
        a request via a hotline, email, online customer service, service centre, or another channel,
        we will instruct the data subject to officially raise the request through one of the
        aforementioned channels to facilitate communication and feedback of progress and results.
        The dedicated request channels for data subjects are intended to protect data subjects'
        lawful interests, ensure Huawei's normal operation, and prevent the right to request from
        being misused or fraudulently used.</p>
    <p>2. Validity of requests</p>
    <p>Most laws require data subjects to comply with specific requirements when they initiate
        requests. This Statement requires data subjects to:</p>
    <p>(1) Submit requests through dedicated request channels provided by Huawei (namely, the
        official website of Huawei Consumer BG, HiCare app, and Huawei ID app).</p>
    <p>(2) Provide sufficient information for Huawei to verify their identities (to ensure those who
        initiate the requests are the data subjects themselves or those authorised by them).</p>
    <p>(3) Ensure that their requests are specific and feasible.</p>
    <p>There are some circumstances, provided by laws and regulations, in which Huawei may not have
        to comply with the request in full or at all.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>B. Consent withdrawal </p>
    <p>You can change the authorised personal data collection scope or withdraw your consent without
        affecting the lawfulness of the processing activities based on the consent and prior to such
        withdraw.</p>
    <p>Your rights can be exercised by deleting information, disabling related functions, or setting
        privacy options on your Huawei product. Huawei will release the methods for withdrawing
        consent for specific products and services in the privacy notice or supplementary statement
        of those products and services or upon request according to section A above.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>C. Deregistering a Huawei ID</p>
    <p>You can deregister your account in Huawei ID-related products. After you deregister your
        account, we will stop providing products and services, and delete your personal data unless
        otherwise stipulated by law. Your account cannot be restored after deregistration. You need
        to register a new Huawei ID if you want to use related Huawei products or services again.
        You can submit a deregistration application and complete the process in setting menu after
        logging in to your Huawei ID on related devices, applications or official website.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>VI. <span id="label_6"/>How Huawei Protects Children's Personal Data</p>
    <p>Huawei's personal and home products are intended for adults. However, for the use of Huawei
        products and services by children, we are fully aware of the importance of taking extra
        preventive measures to protect privacy and security. Huawei identifies whether data subjects
        are children based on the age of majority defined by laws of the local countries and
        regions.</p>
    <p>When children's personal data is collected based on the consent of the holders of parental
        responsibility, we will only use or disclose the information as permitted by law, explicitly
        consented to by the holders of parental responsibility, or required for protecting the
        children. Holders of parental responsibility who need to access, modify, or delete the
        personal data of their children and people under guardianship can contact us via the
        channels provided in &quot;IV. How Huawei Protects Your Personal Data.&quot;</p>
    <p>If Huawei accidentally collects children's personal data without obtaining consent from
        provable holders of parental responsibility, Huawei will delete the information as soon as
        possible after becoming aware of it.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>VII. <span id="label_7"/>Links to Third-Party Websites, Products, and Services</p>
    <p>Huawei websites, application software, products, and services may contain links to
